# Fantasy_Football_Recommender
Fantasy Soccer team predictor which predicts a weekly fantasy team based on game week and player data. This model is tested on data from the 2018-2019 game season and uses data from the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons to train on the 2018-2019 game season. We integrate this model into the backend for a React web application (https://ashritaraman.github.io/Fantasy_Football_Recommender/) which allows users to select a team for a particular game week. Our application calculates the overall score of the team selected by the user and compares it to the score of the team selected by the AI.
